     * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity#Heterozygosity_in_population_genetics
     * <p>

     * which in the GATK is purely determined by the probability of the observed data P(D | AB) under the model that there
     * may be a AB het genotype.  The posterior probability of this AB genotype would use the het prior, but the GATK
     * only uses this posterior probability in determining the prob. that a site is polymorphic.  So changing the
     * het parameters only increases the chance that a site will be called non-reference across all samples, but
     * doesn't actually change the output genotype likelihoods at all, as these aren't posterior probabilities at all.
     * <p>
     * The quantity that changes whether the GATK considers the possibility of a het genotype at all is the ploidy,
     * which determines how many chromosomes each individual in the species carries.
